<h3>  Discover the possible in impossible</h3>
<p>Sweeping your mistakes under the rug isn’t helpful, and neither is getting stuck in a victim mindset. Instead, you need to look failure in the eye and accept it as reality. At the same time, acknowledge the fact that things can be repaired and improved. This crucial step allows you to move into the phase of positive transformation. In Here’s the Key to Turning Your Failures into Victories, Ravi Shankar Rajan explains that:

Kintsugi teaches us to steer clear of all self-defeating emotional conclusions, the “stories” we’ve constructed about how impossible it is for us to recover from our devastation, betrayals, and losses. It raises our self-esteem and tells us that there is no shame in getting defeated or having irreparable drawbacks.</p>
</li>

<h4>Repair and create value</h4>
<p>If you’ve suffered a serious setback, don’t get caught up in “getting over it” or “getting past it”. Be patient: give yourself the time you need to heal and build back up. If the situation was cause by an error on your part, approach it in the spirit of learning and improving. Don’t try to go back to the way things were – that isn’t possible or even desirable. Remember, Kintsugi doesn’t deny or cover up the cracks to look like new; it incorporates them into the design. As Rajan notes in the article mentioned above:

Kintsugi is all about shifting focus from what’s now lost, to what’s been gained. From broken to transformed. From less… to more. It tells us to honor our experiences because when we start doing that, we realize it’s only the splinters, nicks, bruises & breaks in your life that add value to it</p>
