Staple repair is a similar technique used to repair broken ceramic pieces,[18] where small holes are drilled on either side of a crack and metal staples are bent to hold the pieces together.[19] Staple repair was used in Europe (in ancient Greece, England and Russia among others) and China as a repair technique for particularly valuable pieces.

Kintsugi is an ancestral technique that uses gold dust to mend cracked pottery. Translated literally, Kintsugi means: gold carpentry. The tradition dates back to 15th century Japan and embodies a philosophy that exalts the beauty of imperfection, in which cracks are part of life.

Legend has it that, in the 15th century, Japanese emperor Ashikaga Yoshimasa sent a broken ceramic cup to China to be repaired. On seeing the emperor’s disappointment at the poor job returned to him, Japanese artisans set about restoring his cup more beautifully: using resin varnish to repair it and then elegantly decorating the cracks with gold dust.
